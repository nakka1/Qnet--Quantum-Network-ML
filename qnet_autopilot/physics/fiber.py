"""Fibre channel: loss, latency, and the polarisation drift a compensator must track.

Loss and latency are one-liners.  The interesting part is the polarisation
model, because it is the thing the "compensate fibre fluctuations in real time"
problem is actually about, and because a model that gets its *time structure*
wrong will make a predictor look far better or far worse than it would be in
the field.

The model
---------
The fibre's effect on polarisation is a unitary on the qubit, i.e. a rotation
of the Stokes vector on the Poincare sphere.  We track that rotation
:math:`R(t) \\in SO(3)` directly, as the product of three physically distinct
contributions:

.. math:: R(t) = R_{\\text{jump}}(t)\\; R_{\\text{thermal}}(t)\\; R_{\\text{vib}}(t)

**Thermal** — the slow one.  Temperature changes the birefringence of the whole
span, so the rotation performs a random walk over the entire sphere.  The
angular velocity :math:`\\Omega_{\\text{th}}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3` is an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (exactly discretised, so the statistics do not
depend on the step size), optionally driven by a real temperature series
through ``dT/dt``.  This is the component a predictor *can* learn: it is
correlated over minutes and it is coupled to an observable covariate.

**Vibration** — the fast one.  Mechanical stress modulates birefringence in a
narrow acoustic band.  Synthesised as a sum of sinusoids with random phases and
frequencies drawn around the band centre (Rice's method), which gives a
stationary process with exactly the requested RMS amplitude and bandwidth, at
any step size, with no spin-up transient.  This component contributes a bounded
*angle*, not a drift.

**Jumps** — the rare one.  A cable is moved, a splice is disturbed, a patch
panel is touched.  Poisson-timed rotations of a few tenths of a radian.  These
matter out of all proportion to their rate: they are what puts the tail on the
QBER distribution, and no predictor can anticipate them.  A compensator is
judged on how fast it *recovers*, which is a different problem from tracking,
and a dataset without jumps will not teach that difference.

Splitting the three matters because they have different learnability.  Lumping
them into one Gaussian process — the usual shortcut — produces a signal that is
simultaneously too predictable in its tail and too unpredictable in its body.

What comes out
--------------
:meth:`PolarizationDriftModel.simulate` returns a
:class:`PolarizationTrajectory`: the resulting Stokes vector for a chosen launch
state, the misalignment angle, the induced QBER, the environmental covariates
that drove it — and, when asked, the **full rotation** :math:`R(t)`.

That last one is not a convenience.  Where a single Stokes vector went is enough
to compute QBER but **not enough to compensate**: one point on the sphere leaves
a whole U(1) of rotations that could have produced it.  BB84 needs two bases
aligned, so a real polarisation controller monitors two non-parallel probe
states and reconstructs the rotation from both.  A dataset that records only one
state can train a predictor of *misalignment*, which sounds useful and cannot
drive a controller.  ``track_rotation=True`` gives the compensator what it needs.
