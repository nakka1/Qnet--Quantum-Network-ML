"""Measured numbers from deployed fibre, with the source of each one.

Every other parameter in this package is either a transcription of SeQUeNCe or a
plausible operating point chosen from the literature and swept. This module is
different: it holds figures that somebody measured on fibre that is in the
ground or on poles, and it names where each came from. That is the whole point
of it — a constant without a citation is a guess with a decimal point.

What the search actually found
------------------------------
**No public dataset of polarisation on deployed terrestrial fibre exists.** The
raw state-of-polarisation time series that can be downloaded are all submarine
and all sampled at 20 Hz or below — enough for thermal drift and for jump
statistics, useless for anything in the acoustic band. The three best
characterisations of *terrestrial* links (ORNL's 15 km aerial/in-ground, the
NIST-UMD 62 km aerial link, and a 50 km mixed link in Los Angeles) publish the
statistics and withhold the data. So this module records the statistics, and
:mod:`qnet_autopilot.datagen.measured` provides the path that consumes a real
time series if one is obtained.

Two findings that change a result
---------------------------------
**The acoustic band is at the wrong frequency.** Phase 3 puts it at 40 Hz.
Nothing measured supports that. The only 4 kHz polarimeter recording on aerial
fibre that has been published (Peterson, Leo & Rochford, 220 km of
optical-ground-wire)
reports a strong tone at the **power-line frequency with its second and third
harmonics** — 60, 120 and 180 Hz in North America, 50/100/150 Hz on a 50 Hz grid
— because the fibre is strung inside the ground wire of a transmission line and
the current in that conductor is what moves it.

**The drift rate is too fast, and the spectrum says by how much.** ORNL reports
a drift power spectrum going as :math:`f^{-1.0 \pm 0.2}`. That exponent is a
sharp function of the drift rate in this model — the state of polarisation wraps
around the sphere, so drifting faster whitens the spectrum — and matching it
pins the rate to **0.015-0.020 rad/s**, against the 0.05 rad/s phase 3 assumed.
The exponent runs 0.25, 0.30, 0.88, 1.18, 1.66 as the rate falls 0.05, 0.03,
0.02, 0.015, 0.010 — a factor of five in rate covers the whole plausible range
of the exponent, so this is a tight constraint and not a coincidence.
:data:`AERIAL_OPGW` is the resulting operating point and
``scripts/evaluate_field.py`` re-runs the phase-3 comparison there.

A shape that did **not** need fixing: a superposition of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
processes was tried first, on the theory that one relaxation time cannot make a
straight spectrum. It gives a *steeper* exponent than a single process at the
same rate, and is not needed — a single OU at the calibrated rate reproduces the
measured exponent within its uncertainty. :func:`flicker_components` is kept
because multi-timescale drift is a real thing to be able to express, not because
this calibration wanted it.
